This is a very practicing program (exactly, two) with pthread and basic
coding part of C Language. I formerly want to write it with python :)
After thinking a while, I decide to start my very first real program of
pthread.

With CONFIG_USER_SCHED=y in linux kernel, the rt sched program as
pulseaudio, jackd would not get the rt sched before explicit set the
realtime cpu bandwidth for them. However, you could not set this before
there is at least one process running with the corresponding uid.
Obviously, pulseaudio would not login first before his starting.

This tiny program start daemons as the given uid, and then modify the
/sys/kernel/uids/0/cpu_rt_runtime and the set the corresponding
cpu_rt_runtime in /sys/kernel/uids/. So when the program running with
the given uid can get the rt sched as they need.

The pids of the started daemon would stored in files of the uid under
/var/run/userdaemon/.
